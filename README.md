GAD 405

All the files required for this assignment can be found in Creative-Coding/DouglasKellett-405. However, the file path: Creative-Coding/DAT-GAD-405_2017-master/Dynamic Emergencies is where I worked on this project while developing it. 

After opening the project at: https://douglaskellett.github.io/Creative-Coding/DAT-GAD-405_2017-master/Dynamic%20Emergencies/. Simply move the mouse around the screen and see how it reacts and changes. 

Development Process

While making my generative art piece I started by using a loop creating lines so they randomly appear on the screen but the beginning of all the lines were in the centre so that it seemed the lines were all bursting from that point. I tried tying this point to the mouse by setting the values for the first point of the lines as mouseX and mouseY, but I found that it was never interesting enough to stare at it for more than 10 seconds. Even when the mouse moved the inner point of all the lines it didn’t have enough variation. I think this was because using only lines in this way made it very linear and difficult to make much more interesting so the way to solve that would be to use a shape with another dimension. 
Then I tried using rectangles instead of lines and thought made it much more interesting to look at but I still wanted to push it further. I then made it so that according to where the mouse is it decides on the dimensions of the rectangles. This led to a much more interesting viewing experience. I stepped it up again by using this code 4 times but having each one do it on a different part of the screen, top left, top right etc. Each quadrant has different random colours to differentiate them and I think this made it fascinating enough to look at. 
One problem I have with my code is that when the mouse is in the top left corner of the screen the point in between the 4 quadrants moves away from the curser, while this doesn’t ruin the experience I would like to be able to fix this in the future. I would also like to be able to find ways to add to it without overloading what is viewable.
